# ⚠️ Important Safety Warnings and Precautions

## Electrical Safety

- Never connect or disconnect components while the circuit is powered
- Ensure proper voltage levels (3.3V) for ESP32 connections
- Use appropriate resistors for LED connections
- Avoid short circuits by double-checking connections

## WiFi Security

- Change default credentials before deploying
- Avoid exposing sensitive network information
- Use secure connections when possible
- Keep firmware updated

## Usage Limitations

- This project is intended for educational and development purposes
- Not recommended for critical or production applications without proper security measures
- Indoor use only, unless properly enclosed

## Known Issues

1. Web interface may need refresh if connection is lost
2. LED status might have slight delay due to network latency
3. Multiple simultaneous connections might affect performance
